# Sudoku
This is an implemenation of the classic number puzzle game Sudoku, along with an algorthim to solve any given Sudoku puzzle. The goal is to have implement a solver that can run as fast as possible, hence the use of C. Nothing to serious, just a toy project to stay fluent in my C.

## Installation 

### Ubuntu/Debian

You will need gcc and make in order to build the project. You can install them using the following:
```
$ sudo apt install gcc
$ sudo apt install make
$ sudo apt-get install libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev
```

### Windows/MacOS/Others
Idk, you'll have to Google it. I don't own a MacOS device and I don't develop on Windows.
